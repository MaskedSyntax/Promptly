## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Promptly is built with modern, high-performance tools to ensure reliability and extensibility:

### **Core Technology**
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**:
  - Chosen for its memory safety, speed, and concurrency model, Rust ensures a secure and efficient browsing experience.
- **[WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/)**:
  - A lightweight, open-source rendering engine that supports modern web standards (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript).
- **[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/)**:
  - A versatile, cross-platform UI library for building clean, user-friendly interfaces.

### **Key Libraries**
- **[serde](https://serde.rs/)** and **[serde_yaml](https://docs.rs/serde_yaml)**:
  - For YAML-based configuration management.
- **[rustls](https://docs.rs/rustls/)**:
  - Ensures secure communication with HTTPS enforcement.
- **[easylist_parser](https://github.com/twmb/easylist-rust)**:
  - Parses blocklists to support ad-blocking.
- **[gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/)**:
  - Provides bindings to GTK and WebKitGTK for seamless integration with Rust.

### **Why Rust?**
- **Performance**: Rust delivers near-C/C++ speeds, ensuring fast rendering and low resource usage.
- **Memory Safety**: With Rust's ownership model, Promptly is free of common memory-related vulnerabilities.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's async model allows smooth multitasking (e.g., tabs, splits, and parallel queries).

### Focus Areas:
- **Security**:
  - Sandboxing for safe browsing.
  - HTTPS enforced by default.
- **Rendering Quality**:
  - Modern web standards support (HTML5, CSS3, JS).
